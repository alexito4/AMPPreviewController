/**
 *  AMPPreviewController is a subclass of QLPreviewController that
 *  allows you to preview remote documents.
 *
 *  This class downloads the document and then reloads the preview.
 *
 *  This class is designed to work with only one document at a time.
 *  Also you can use a NSURL directly! Without the need of creating a QLPreviewItem conforming object.
 *  So the developer doesn't need to deal with dataSource methods, just instantiate and present ;)
